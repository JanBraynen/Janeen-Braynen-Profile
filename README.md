## About Me  
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Doreen Wareâ€™s lab. My research focuses on understanding nutrient adaptation mechanisms in Sorghum, with the aim of improving crop resilience and productivity. By integrating transcriptomics, elemental analysis, and phenotypic assessments, I address key challenges in sustainable agriculture, particularly in nutrient-limited environments.

## Current Projects  

### **Carbon Partitioning NAM (CP-NAM) Founders**  
- **Goal**: Uncover mechanisms for Fe-use efficiency and carbon allocation.  
- **Methods**:  
  - Hydroponic growth trials under Fe-deficient and Fe-excess conditions.  
  - RNA-seq for gene expression profiling.  
  - ICP-MS to analyze elemental concentrations (e.g., Fe54, Ca44, S34, Na23, B11).  
- **Key Insight**: Leoti founder line exhibits unique Fe homeostasis, suggesting a hybrid uptake strategy combining Strategy I and II mechanisms.  

### **A-lines Forage Sorghum**  
- **Goal**: Investigate nitrogen adaptation in forage sorghum lines to improve productivity and mitigate nitrogen toxicity in animal feed.  
- **Methods**:  
  - Single-cell RNA-seq to map stress-responsive pathways.  
  - Phenotypic evaluation under nutrient stress conditions.  
- **Key Insight**: Identified nitrogen-responsive genes that enhance productivity and resilience.
